Welcome, I'm happy to share my projects with all of you through github. My programming journey began in 2022, but became official in 2023, when I joined the Computer Science course at Cruzeiro do Sul, remotely. Throughout this journey, I was able to discover myself and chart a path that I want to achieve, to be a professional of the future, I seek to improve myself by adopting new knowledge and skills. Currently, I have a wide range of practical skills in the area. I dream of, one day, becoming one of the female leaders in this unequal environment, I want to influence women to become great protagonists.
